# SDLC Model Selection Report â€“ "Eco-Eats"

For the Eco-Eats project, we created a comparison table of different SDLC models. We first selected categories that are most important for this project, such as requirement clarity, flexibility for changes, fast delivery (MVP), user feedback integration, risk handling, and project size suitability. Then, we assigned priorities to these categories based on the project's needs. After this, we evaluated each SDLC model (Waterfall, V-Model, Iterative, Spiral, Prototyping, Agile) against the chosen categories and gave them numerical scores out of 100. Finally, we calculated the total score for each model.

| Criteria | Waterfall | V-Model | Iterative | Spiral | Prototyping | Agile |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Requirement Clarity | 80 | 85 | 75 | 70 | 65 | 90 |
| Flexibility for Changes | 30 | 35 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 95 |
| Fast Delivery (MVP) | 40 | 45 | 70 | 60 | 75 | 90 |
| User Feedback Integration | 30 | 40 | 70 | 75 | 85 | 95 |
| Risk Handling | 40 | 60 | 70 | 85 | 55 | 80 |
| Project Size Suitability | 65 | 70 | 80 | 85 | 65 | 90 |
| **Total Score (out of 100)** | **47** | **56** | **73** | **76** | **75** | **90** |

In this evaluation, the models scored as follows:
- Waterfall: 47/100
- V Model: 56/100
- Iterative: 73/100
- Spiral: 76/100
- Prototyping: 75/100
- Agile: 90/100

Since Agile scored the highest (90/100), we selected the **Agile SDLC model** as the most suitable for Eco-Eats. This is because Agile supports frequent user feedback, fast delivery of an MVP, and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements, which are crucial for a health and nutrition tracking application where new features and improvements will be added incrementally. Therefore, for the Eco-Eats project, the Agile model is the best option, as it ensures continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and scalability.
